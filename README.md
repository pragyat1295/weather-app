## Pages:

- This is the normal weather app which will show the details of the city and show their graphs and other data on the details page which is the next page of the application. 

- First page is the map page which display 2 markers whose location has been hard coded. Other component for this page is the card component which displays 
the data and the data is coming from the .json file which is in data folder.

- On click on the card component, it will lead you to the details of that particular city.

## Work Flow:

- For the design I have used MUI and vanilla css.
- For the tables MUI tables has been used.
- For the graphs I have used chart-js.
- To avoid the unnecessary bundling of the pages, I have used the lazy loading on the page render
